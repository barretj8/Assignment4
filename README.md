2. The most challenging part of the assignment was not being able to get the Kubernetes running on AWS. I was not able to figure this issue out.
3. I tried implementing the Parameter store, however you will not see it in the final submission because I was not able to get it functional and I needed to move on to the next part of the assignment. Also, when working with the Kubernetes, I was able to get them applied (see image labeled Kubernetes Deployment) but then the memory on this Cloud9 instance ran out. After restarting, I was unable to get back to that point. However, when I was able to get them applied, I kept hanging on getting the app deployed. I did have a port open but I ran into an issue with the Kubernetes Pods. If I could get back to that state, I would have looked to see why they were failing and made the futher changes required. 
4. In the video, I showed my EC2 instance and the Docker Hub repo to prove that I was successful in those parts. However, I was unable to get the app deployed so I could not have shown anything for that requirement. Because I couldn't get the app deployed, there isn't much to see for the infrastructure. I did make changes to the app.js file and the posts.controllers.js file to have hopefully made the posts work if the app had been deployed.
