2. The most challenging part of the assignment was not being able to get the Kubernetes running on AWS. I was not able to figure this issue out.
3. I tried implementing the Parameter store, however you will not see it in the final submission because I was not able to get it functional and I needed to move on to the next part of the assignment. Also, when working with the Kubernetes, I was able to get them applied (see image labeled Kubernetes Deployment) but then the memory on this Cloud9 instance ran out. After restarting, I was unable to get back to that point.
