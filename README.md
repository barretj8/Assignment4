2. The most challenging part of the assignment revolved around configuring Kubernetes on AWS. Unfortunately, I was unable to resolve the issues.
3. Although I attempted to implement the Parameter store, it's absent from the final submission due to functionality issues. This compelled me to progress to the subsequent part of the assignment. While working with Kubernetes, I managed to apply them (refer to the image labeled "Kubernetes Deployment" on GitHub). However, the Cloud9 instance's memory became exhausted after this process, hindering my progress. Despite many attempts to restore it, I couldn't get back to that state. Additionally, even though I managed to deploy them earlier, I faced challenges deploying the application. Although I had an open port, I encountered issues with the Kubernetes Pods. Given the opportunity to revert to that state, I would have investigated the causes of their failure and made the necessary adjustments.
4. The video showcased my successful configuration of the EC2 instance and the Docker Hub repository. Unfortunately, the app deployment remained unresolved, resulting in a lack of demonstration for that requirement. As the app deployment faltered, there wasn't must visible progress in terms of infrastructure. I did, however, make modifications to the 'app.js' and 'posts.controllers.js' files in anticipation of the app's successful deployment, aiming to rectify issues with the post's functionality.
